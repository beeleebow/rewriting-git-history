# Rewriting Git History

This is a campanion repository for my Pluralsight course, [Rewriting Git History](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/rewriting-git-history).

## Following along

You can get to the staring point, i.e. a messy commit history on a branch called `start`, by running:

```bash
> ./start.sh
```

You can get to the end point, i.e. a clean commit history on a branch called `end`, by running:

```bash
> ./end.sh
```

> Note that these scripts will hard reset `master` and push it to the remote.
