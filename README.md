# Rewriting Git History

This is a campanion repository for my Pluralsight course, [Rewriting Git History](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/rewriting-git-history).

## Following along

You can get to the staring point, i.e. a messy commit history by running the `start.sh` script from a new branch.

```bash
> git checkout -b my-new-branch
> ./start.sh
```
